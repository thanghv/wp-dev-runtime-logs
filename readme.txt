Monitoring development logs and performance made simple for teams.

== Description ==

**WP Dev Runtime Logs** is a lightweight developer tool for WordPress that simplifies log monitoring, debugging, and performance tracking during the development phase.
It helps developers, testers, and managers quickly identify performance bottlenecks, trace runtime behavior, and analyze issues directly from the WordPress dashboard â€” without relying on external tools.

With this plugin, you can:
- View and filter logs directly within the WordPress dashboard.
- Track execution time in real time for performance analysis.
- Debug runtime behavior quickly and efficiently.
- Organize logs per page or globally across the site.
- Copy logs to memory for quick sharing.
- Export logs to file for documentation or review.

This tool is recommended for use in **development or staging environments**, not for production sites.
